Paracetamol is a drug of choice for reducing fever. However, there has been a lack of research on its antipyretic properties, particularly in adults. The most recent review on paracetamol and management of fever in the general practice (2008) argued that its benefits are unclear. In addition, when used for the common cold, paracetamol may relieve a stuffed or runny nose, but not other cold symptoms such as a sore throat, malaise, sneezing, or cough; however, these data are of poor quality.For patients in critical care, paracetamol decreased body temperature by only 0.2-0.3 Â°C more than control interventions; there was no difference in mortality. It did not change the outcome in febrile patients with stroke. The results are contradictory for paracetamol use in sepsis: higher mortality, lower mortality, and no change in mortality were all reported. Paracetamol offered no benefit in the treatment of dengue fever and was accompanied by a higher rate of liver enzyme elevation: a sign of a potential liver damage. Overall, there is no support for a routine administration of antipyretic drugs, including paracetamol, to hospitalized patients with fever and infection.
